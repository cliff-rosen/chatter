Changes in Drug Level Laboratory Results
How does DoseMeRx respond when there is a drug level significantly different than previous
ones?
Written by Sharmeen Roy, PharmD, BCPS
Updated over a week ago
Throughout a patients course of therapy, there may be times where a drug level may be 
significantly higher than previous drug levels.
When there are multiple laboratory results that disagree with one another, it may be because 
one is incorrect (e.g. it was drawn at the wrong time) or the patients pharmacokinetic 
parameters have changed.
DoseMeRx wont ignore earlier laboratory results just because a subsequent one has been

parameters have changed.
DoseMeRx wont ignore earlier laboratory results just because a subsequent one has been 
added. While newer results are considered somewhat more trustworthy, if both are quite 
different, DoseMeRx will tend to prefer the one most like the population model (as this is more 
common in the population). Therefore, it may recommend a different dose than what would be 
customary for a patient if only the most recent result was considered.
Here are two approaches to consider when this is encountered:
If the accuracy of the outlier drug level is questionable:
 . Consider obtaining another level if possible to validate the accuracy of the most recent 
level.
 . If you cannot obtain a level, exclude the last level and DoseMeRx will calculate the dose 
based on the prior existing levels.
If the most recent drug level value is considered to be correct:
9/14/23, 4:09 PM Changes in Drug Level Laboratory Results | DoseMe Help Center

based on the prior existing levels.
If the most recent drug level value is considered to be correct:

https://help.doseme-rx.com/en/articles/3353676-changes-in-drug-level-laboratory-results 2/2doseme-rx.com
 . Exclude earlier drug levels (if the last result is considered correct and you think a change 
has taken place).
Laboratory results can be excluded in DoseMeRx by selecting the Lab Results tab and selecting 
Edit on the laboratory value. A pop up box will show the time stamp of the laboratory result, 
the drug concentration, and serum creatinine if available. Unselect the checkbox include in 
calculations and then select Save.

Yes. DoseMeRx has been used in adult patients ranging from 35kg to 340kg. DoseMeRx uses a 
wide range of different ways of representing weight - a significant part of our model validation 
process is ensuring that the patients weight is accurately represented for the drug. For 
example, a 350kg patient does not have kidneys 7x as efficient than a 70kg patient.

example, a 350kg patient does not have kidneys 7x as efficient than a 70kg patient. 
When the model is implemented, we utilize the weight that was used in the original model 
design. There are a wide variety of weight measures that can be utilized in the models, including:
- Total body weight
- Ideal body weight
- Lean body weight
- Adjusted ideal body weight
- Body surface area.
DoseMeRx provides a significant benefit in dosing patients at different ends of the weight 
spectrum - every patient is an individual, and weight is just one component that we consider.

Amputees have a different relationship between height, weight, and Vd to non-amputee patients.
Learn how to use DoseMeRx in this cohort.
Written by Sharmeen Roy, PharmD, BCPS
Updated over a week ago
While DoseMeRx does not have amputee-specific models (and at the time of writing, we do not 
believe that there exist any that would pass our validation process).
There are two primary places in antibiotic pharmacokinetic models where amputation has an 
effect: the volume of distribution is altered, and the calculation of creatinine clearance is also 
altered.
While some calculators adjust the patient's weight to indirectly alter Vd based on the type and

altered.
While some calculators adjust the patient's weight to indirectly alter Vd based on the type and 
number of amputations, this doesn't address creatinine clearance. The limited literature 
available suggests that eCrCL tends to be over-estimated in this cohort. You may want to 
consider using a pre-amputation height (if available) along with the current patient weight. 
For DoseMeRx, we recommend treating these patients like any that may be outside of the 
patient cohort used to generate the model. Because these patients are not typically included in 
a population model, it is recommended to calculate the first dose based on either the Guideline 
Dose or a local protocol outside of DoseMeRx.

==============
function over the course of several weeks. It handles fluctuating renal function by allowing 
multiple serum creatinine entries. DoseMeRx will use the most recent entries to calculate any 
future doses and (for most models) use historical data to calculate eGFR/eCRCL  using a 
method such as Cockcroft-Gault (for adults) and Schwartz (for pediatrics) to determine the 
relationship between vancomycin clearance and creatinine clearance. This allows drug clearance 
to vary over time as eCRCL varies.
In addition, to improve the model fit, DoseMeRx will linearly interpolate between adjacent serum 
creatinine lab measurements.
However, since serum creatinine is a later marker of renal function, anuria can occur prior to a 
measurable rise in serum creatinine, This means that just like any other tool, scoring method, or 
alerting method that uses serum creatinine, the clinician needs to evaluate this information in 
the context of the overall patient's clinical status.

Updated over a week ago
Sometimes laboratory values may be recorded while the medication is infusing. When this 
occurs, the first step is to confirm that the drug level was, in fact, obtained during the infusion. 
If the drug level was not drawn during the infusion, updating the drug level to the correct time in

On the Dosing Calculation page, the method for calculating the eCrCl is indicated in parenthesis 
after the displayed value. Unless otherwise noted, for adults, eCrCl is calculated using 
Cockcroft-Gault, using the lower of ideal body weight (IBW) or total body weight (TBW), and a 
minimum serum creatinine of 0.68 mg/dL (60 mol/L) as described by Duffull et al. (Br J Clin 
Pharmacol 1997; 43: 125135) . We do this to avoid estimating unphysiologically high CrCl which 
could otherwise occur for outlier patients with low serum creatinine results. For pediatrics, we 
utilize Schwartz unless otherwise noted.If there is no serum creatinine entered for the patient, 
DoseMeRx will utilize an average population-based serum creatinine that is based on the 
patient's age and sex.
If enabled, the eCrCl will also be displayed in the pharmacokinetics section of the final dosing 
recommendation report, allowing for convenient comparison. Both the calculation using IBW and

table that provide detailed information related to vancomycin dosing and pharmacokinetic (PK) 
parameters including AUC tau (T), AUC24, peak and trough.
You will notice that the PK related values displayed for the most recent dose are italicized. This 
is because at the time that these values are being calculated, the date and time of the next dose 
has not been recorded yet . Therefore, DoseMeRx will use the previous dosing interval (e.g. 9 
hours in the example below) to estimate the expected PK parameters.  Once the date and time 
of the next dose has been recorded, the table will update with this new information. Keep in 
mind that these are estimates based on the individualization of the pharmacokinetic model,  
therefore, there may be slight differences between the estimated value displayed on this table

DoseMeRx has a quick and easy feature to show you a visual representation of how the model is 
fitting to your patient's data. This article covers what model fit is, how it is calculated and how to 
interpret it.
What is model fit?
Model fit is a term used to describe how well the selected model fits the observed data. In 
general, a better fit corresponds to a more accurate dosing recommendation.

Model fit is a term used to describe how well the selected model fits the observed data. In

How is it calculated?
When a model is fitted, DoseMeRx works to provide an estimate of the patients specific 
pharmacokinetics based on the model selected. Model fit distills the difference between the 
model predicted vs. measured drug levels down to a single value. This value is used to inform 
the model fit status indicator that is displayed.

Good fit: The icon above, when displayed, indicates the measured drug levels from the patient 
are in agreement with the model and suggest a Good Fit. You can also see this in the Historical 
Plot graph as indicated by the blue line being closer or even crossing through the recorded drug

How can I improve model fit for my patient? 
Four ways to improve model fit
 . Always check that data has been entered correctly. Data entry issues 
comprise about 50% of the cases of poor model fit.
 . Consider deselecting older levels in patients who have a longer course of 
therapy and have varying vancomycin pk throughout their stay.

Model fit should always be reviewed in combination with the Historical Plot. As with any feature 
in DoseMeRx, model fit is intended to be used as a guide only and should not supersede your 
clinical judgment.

The value of drug levels in individualizing a patient model
Written by Sharmeen Roy, PharmD, BCPS
Updated over a week ago
DoseMeRx uses a population pharmacokinetic model which incorporates the patient's 
demographics (e.g. weight, height, sex) and any previous relevant laboratory values (e.g. serum 
creatinine) together with Bayesian methods to estimate an individual patient's clearance, volume 
of distribution, and other PK parameters.
In the absence of a drug level, the population model will be used to calculate the dose. However, 
a single laboratory result (e.g. drug level) is all that DoseMeRx needs to begin individualization
==============
In the absence of a drug level, the population model will be used to calculate the dose. However, 
a single laboratory result (e.g. drug level) is all that DoseMeRx needs to begin individualization 
of the pharmacokinetic model resulting in targeted recommendations.
Due to the way that Bayesian dosing works, if your patient is similar to the cohort used to 
develop the model, a single level will give a high-quality fit. However, for patients that are 
different than the model cohort, obtaining an additional level at a different time during the 
interval, will give another point for DoseMeRx to use in the Bayesian fitting. When fitting a model 
to a patient, DoseMeRx will strive to fit all of the observed data to find the most likely set of 
individualized pharmacokinetic values to minimize these sources of external influences to the 
extent possible.

DoseMeRx is able to learn over time and create a more customized, individualized model of your 
patient as more information (e.g. updated lab values and drug levels) are received for the

Once youve logged into DoseMeRx, you will land on the patient dashboard screen. Users will 
select Add patient and enter the requested information and a drug model for the course.
Upon selecting Save Patient, you will be brought to the historical plot. If a serum creatinine value 
is available, we encourage you to enter it on the Lab Results tab, but you can move forward with

default serum creatinine of  69.5 umol/L (0.786 mg/dL) for females and 84 umol/L (0.95 mg/dL) 
for males will be used in the model calculations.
Having no historic doses or lab results, DoseMeRx will use the population model to provide a 
dose recommendation for this patient. This approach utilizes all information that we currently 
know about the patient (height, weight, age, sex, and serum creatinine if applicable) and runs 
this information against the population model and DoseMeRx algorithm to produce the 
Population Model-Based Dose.

When a laboratory result is recorded for the patient, if the level observed is considered to be 
highly likely, the blue line will be close or may even cross through the recorded level on the

population drug model, DoseMeRx will assume that there has been an error with the result and 
will weight it minimally when building the model for your individual patient. Essentially, the 
further any laboratory result is from what DoseMeRx considers likely, the less impact that result 
will have on the individual model.The graphic below illustrates this concept.

Individualized Dose). Both dosing recommendations are informed by the pharmacokinetic 
model that you have selected.
The Population-Model Based Dose, is the recommendation that is displayed in the absence of

patient's demographics (e.g. height, weight, sex, and age) and renal function, but assumes that 
your patients pharmacokinetics are similar to the population model. If your patient's 
pharmacokinetics are not similar to the patient population used to develop the model, it may 
result in doses that are too high, or too low initially. In these cases, the guideline dose may be 
more appropriate to use until drug levels can be obtained.
However, once a drug level is obtained, the model is "fitted" using Bayesian science to produce 
an individualized dose recommendation. In DoseMeRx, this is referred to as the Default 
Individualized Target (Individualized Dose). This new individual model is then used to provide 
a patient-specific dosing recommendation to reach the desired therapeutic target.

doses as well, where applicable.
Fluctuating renal function/Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
DoseMeRx can be utilized in patients with fluctuating renal function or AKI. Of course, serum 
creatinine is a later marker of renal function, which means that just like any other tool, scoring

As this model fits a more complex pharmacokinetic curve, in order to get the best individual fit, 
two random lab results (not necessarily on the same dose) are most effective at individualizing 
the two phases for the patient using this model. The use of this model is highly recommended in 
complex patients already having multiple levels taken, such as those in ICU.

Dosing vancomycin in patients on hemodialysis with DoseMeRx
Written by Sharmeen Roy, PharmD, BCPS
Updated over a week ago
At DoseMeRx, we've implemented a range of vancomycin models to help you optimize therapy 
for a variety of patient cohorts.
An overview of the hemodialysis (HD) model
The adult HD model in DoseMeRx is derived from the Goti et retrospective study which included 
336 patients on high-flux, intermittent HD. Study researchers found that clearance in patients 
undergoing HD was 35% lower than clearance in non-dialysis patients, and the volume of 
distribution was approximately halved in dialysis patients when compared to nondialysis patients.
==============
undergoing HD was 35% lower than clearance in non-dialysis patients, and the volume of 
distribution was approximately halved in dialysis patients when compared to nondialysis patients.
When using the model, entering dialysis times is not required because this model uses a 
smoothed average of vancomycin clearance across the "on" and "off" dialysis periods. 
Patients may be dosed using trough or AUC24 depending on your institutional preference. 
How to incorporate the model into your workflow 
This can best be demonstrated using a sample patient. (Note: Although this example references 
AUC24, the workflow is similar if dosing to a specific pre-dialysis level [i.e. trough).
Lets say we have a patient who receives a loading dose of vancomycin on a Monday prior to an 
HD session (on the same day) and then receives a second dose of vancomycin on a Wednesday 
(post HD). Prior to HD on Friday, a pre-dialysis level is obtained and this is used to calculate the

450mg.h/L.
The individualized dosing calculation that will be displayed in this example will reflect the 
predicted pk/pd parameters that will be achieved based on your institutional defaults. For 
example, if the institutional defaults are set to 1 dose (with the default interval set at 48 hours), 
the predicted "trough" that is displayed will represent the expected concentration at the end of 
the time frame specified and the AUC that is displayed represents the estimated AUC
==============
the predicted "trough" that is displayed will represent the expected concentration at the end of 
the time frame specified and the AUC that is displayed represents the estimated AUC 
extrapolated to 24 hours. As a reminder, the customized section can be used to calculate doses 
across longer dosing intervals if needed (e.g. 72 hours or over a weekend).
An easy way to visualize this is to hover over the Default Individualized Dose Profile which will 
show you the predicted vancomycin level at any point in time during therapy (Figure 1).  The 
corresponding values for each dose are also displayed in the table on the dosing screen.

HD level may be needed (ideally obtained at least 2 hours post HD per guidelines). 
 . To reduce the number of additional labs, another option would be to move from pre-HD 
levels to post HD levels. 
 . Ensure that any doses and levels that have been given prior to admission are documented. If 
there are no doses documented, DoseMeRx will assume that the patient is starting with a 
blood level of zero which can impact the calculations.

Why is this model suitable for my general ward patients on vancomycin?
As there are less free parameters to fit with a single-compartment model, an individualized fit is 
more likely to be achieved from a single trough level. DoseMeRx also has known accuracy for 
trough targets in clinical practice which means we know how accurate the predicted drug 
concentration will be in relation to the actual drug concentration. You can read more about the

What are the differences between these models for adult patients?
Although vancomycin is typically characterized as a 2 or even a 3-compartment model, there 
are numerous pharmacokinetic (PK) studies that describe a 1-compartment model that are 
commonly used in Bayesian dosing. Within DoseMeRx, we have two standard vancomycin 
models that are applicable for use in a wide range of adults who are not currently receiving 
dialysis.

commonly used in Bayesian dosing. Within DoseMeRx, we have two standard vancomycin 
models that are applicable for use in a wide range of adults who are not currently receiving 
dialysis.
Of course, the decision on which model to select when you have access to both is based on 
your own clinical judgment. However, understanding the differences will help you determine 
which model may be more suitable for your patient.
One (1)-Compartment Vancomycin Model
Background: The one-compartment vancomycin model implemented in DoseMeRx is derived 
from a retrospective study conducted in 215 patients (Buelga et al. AAC 2005). It has been 
further validated in multiple publications and used clinically in over 10,000 patients with a wide 
range of conditions. Total body weight and creatinine clearance are the covariates in this model.

https://help.doseme-rx.com/en/articles/3922281-vancomycin-one-compartment-vs-two-compartment-models 2/3Creatinine clearance is calculated using ideal body weight. In cases where serum creatinine is 
less than 0.68mg/dL (60 mol/L), the value is rounded up to the 0.68mg/dL (60 mol/L) 
minimum threshold.  The 1 compartment model is validated for use for patients weighing 
between 40 and 200kg and height between 150 and 220cm.
With a single compartment model, there are less free parameters to fit. Therefore, an 
individualized fit is more likely to be achieved from a single trough level. It will model a 
smoothed average of the 2 compartments. A recent paper found that a 1 compartment model 
may be sufficient to guide vancomycin dosing in adult patients with stable renal function
==============
smoothed average of the 2 compartments. A recent paper found that a 1 compartment model 
may be sufficient to guide vancomycin dosing in adult patients with stable renal function 
(Shingde RV, et al. Ther Drug Monitor 2019).
Summary: The 1 compartment model may be suitable for patients who are less complex 
medically and have stable renal function.
Two (2)-Compartment Vancomycin Model
Background: The two-compartment vancomycin adult model implemented in DoseMeRx is 
derived from a retrospective study with a cohort of 1,812 patients (Goti et al. Ther Drug Monitor 
2018) . This model is particularly useful for AUC-based dosing as it models both the distribution 
and elimination phases of vancomycin. Total body weight and creatinine clearance are the 
covariates in this model (for non-hemodialysis patients). Creatinine clearance is calculated 
based on Cockroft-Gault using ideal body weight. For patients over 65, it rounds the minimum

covariates in this model (for non-hemodialysis patients). Creatinine clearance is calculated 
based on Cockroft-Gault using ideal body weight. For patients over 65, it rounds the minimum 
serum creatinine value used up to 1 mg/dL (88.4mol/L). Creatinine clearance is "capped" at a 
maximum of 150mL/min for all patients.  This model is validated for use for patients weighing 
between 40 and 200kg and height between 150 and 220cm. A 2019 review of pharmacometric 
models for Bayesian forecasting found that this model had a high predictive performance 
(Broeker et al. Clin Microbiol Infect 2019).
As this model fits a more complex pharmacokinetic curve, in order to get the best individual fit, 
two lab results, such as a post-infusion peak and a trough, are most effective at individualizing 
the two phases for the patient using this model. There is flexibility in the timing of the levels that

altered clearance or volume of distribution, such as those in the ICU. However, due to the way 9/14/23, 4:04 PM Vancomycin One Compartment vs Two Compartment Models | DoseMe Help Center
