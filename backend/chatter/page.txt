The Next Generation of Leaders
"Throughout the program, I learned how to become an effective advocate for not only animal rights, but for any issue I feel inspired to work on. Becoming familiar with the reality of factory farming made a lot of my hopes for activism and advocacy seem more clear, and I learned that I am capable of making much more change than I ever even considered."
